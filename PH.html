Filipino is the Hispanized
 (or Anglicized) way of referring 
 to both the people and the language 
 in the Philippines. Note that it is 
 also correct to say Filipino for a 
 male and Filipina for a female.
 Never use or say" <i>Philippino</i>,
 "because that doesn't sound right.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, <i>Pilipino,</i>
 is how the locals from the
 Philippines refer to themselves,
 or to their national language. 
 When applied to the language, 
 <i>Pilipino</i> is synonymous with Tagalog,
 the language widely spoken 
 in Manila, Bulacan, Bataan, and 
 Batangas. The "P" or "Ph" is
 used because most Filipino languages
 do not have the "F" sound 
 (with the exception of some native
 people in the Cordillera and
 Mindanao, like the Ifugao and the
 Teduray). Today, the Filipino 
 alphabet consists of 28 characters,
 with the letters F, Ø± and Ng 
 added on top of V, Q, X, Z and 
 other Latin characters. The same 
 goes for <i>Pilipinas,</i> which is the
 name of the country itself. It is 
 derived from the Hispanized word
 <i>Filipinas,</i> the old Spanish name of
 the country <i>Las Islas Filipinas</i> 
 (Anglicized equivalent: Philippine 
 Islands or P.I., when it was still a 
 colony).The "Ph" is from Philip, the 
 English equivalent of the Spanish 
 King Felipe II.
 
</p>

<p>
<i>Pinoy </i> is the shortened, colloquial
 version for Filipino to mean the 
 people, <i>but never</i> the language. It
 becomes <i>Pinay</i> when referring to a female,
 although Pinoy is also used to refer to 
 both male and female.
 </p>
 
<p>
 "Modernization" of the Philippine 
 national language has incorporated 
 these new characters into the alphabet
 since 1987,<i>baybayin</i>  <b>it's baybayin and not alibata.</b>

 Part of the reason is 
 that the traditional Abakada is 
 limited and sometimes sounds funny
 or becomes the butt of jokes, as in 
 the way certain words are spelled. For 
 example, <i>bote</i> (bottle) and <i>titik</i> (letters)
 are spelled Abakada style as "ba-o-ta-e"
 and "ta-i-ta-i-ka," which even make
 children die laughing! The accepted way
 is to spell these words as "bi-o-ti-ey" 
 and "ti-i-ti-i-key" or something to that
 effect.
